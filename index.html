        <ul>
            <li>1. Add the oil to the pot with 2 or 3 kernels of corn. If
                using coconut oil, melt the oil in the pot first, then
                add a couple of kernels.
                2. Turn the pot to medium-high heat, cover and wait
                for the 2-3 kernels to burst into popcorn.
                3. When the kernels pop, add the rest of the â…“ cup of
                popcorn kernels in an even layer (try to keep them
                in a single layer).
                4. Cover the pot and gently shake it by moving it back
                and forth over the burner.
                5. As the popcorn pops, try to keep the lid slightly ajar
                to let the steam from the popcorn release (the
                popcorn will be drier and crisper).
                6. Once the popping slows to several seconds
                between pops, remove the pan from heat, remove
                the lid, and dump the popcorn into a bowl.
                7. Gather your toppings, drizzle over the popcorn, and
                toss to distribute. Add butter if desired. Enjoy!

            <li>Step 1
                Wash the chicken with fresh water and pat dry with a kitchen cloth. Cut the chicken into small pieces. Grind the ginger and onion in a blender jar and then press the mixture and add its juice to the chicken pieces. Add salt to this. Mix well and keep it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Take another bowl, add water and soak all the cashews in this bowl and keep aside.
                
                Step 2
                Take a kadhai, add green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves, mace, bay leaves, cinnamon, coriander seeds, black pepper and roast them for 3-4 minutes. Remove from the flame and let them cool down. After this, put them in a blender and add ginger and garlic to it and blend them to a fine paste.
                
                Step 3
                Add the tomatoes in a blender jar and grind them to form a paste. Chop the remaining onion. In the same kadhai, add ghee and place it on medium flame. Once the ghee melts, add the chopped onions and caramelize them for 5 minutes</li>
